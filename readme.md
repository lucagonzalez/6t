Shell Script Exercises
======================
A series of Shell Script Exercises, part 3
----------------------------------------
### 6t
You should write a Shell Script that, from a file of groups and users of a system, analyze it and show how many groups there are on the screen, how many users each group has and what is the group that has more users. To do this, the use of the wc command will be penalized.

This file has several lines, where the first value of each line represents the name of the group, and from the colon, they are all users belonging to that group separated by spaces.

Some clarifications:
- The file name must be entered by the user. If the user enters a name of a file that does not exist, he must show an error message and ask the user for the name again.
- The Script must work well with any file that the user enters and that has the indicated format.
- If there are more than one group with the same maximum number of users, the name of all of them must be shown.
